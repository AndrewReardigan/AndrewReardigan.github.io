# Week 0 Project: The Fan Site
You'll use GitHub Pages to create a fan-site about something. It's 1997 all over again!

## Goals
Your fan-site should have the following things:
 - You'll use GitHub Pages to create a fan-site about something. It's 1997 all over again!
 - Create a GitHub repo on your personal account named `[YOUR GITHUB USER NAME].github.io`
 - If I go to `[YOUR GITHUB USER NAME].github.io`, it should NOT give me a 404 Page ("There isn't a GitHub Pages site here.")
 - It should have a README.md file.

## Notes
 - There may be a situation where you make changes and it may take some time for it to appear. This is because of something called caching.
