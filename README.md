# Week 0 Project: The Fan Site
You'll use GitHub Pages to create a fan-site about something. It's 1997 all over again!

## Goals
Your fan-site should have the following things:
 - There should be repo on your personal GitHub account named `[YOUR GITHUB USER NAME].github.io`
 - If I go to `[YOUR GITHUB USER NAME].github.io`, it should NOT give me a 404 Page ("There isn't a GitHub Pages site here.")
 - There should be content about the thing you're fanning over. 
 - It should have a `README.md` file, which explains what your code does. You'll be adding a `README.md` file on all of the projects you do. [(Huh? Why is that important?)](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-readmes)

## Notes
 - There may be a situation where you make changes and it may take some time for it to appear. This is because of something called caching.
